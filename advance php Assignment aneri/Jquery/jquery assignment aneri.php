 Sarting Point Of Code Execution In JQuery :-

 '$(document).ready() function' is the starting point of jQuery code. It is executed when DOM is loaded.
        
 3)

 The key difference between $(document). ready() and $(window). load() 
 event is that the code included inside onload function will run once 
 the entire page(images, iframes, stylesheets,etc) are loaded whereas the $(document). ready() 
 event fires before all images,iframes etc

 $(window).load()

The code which gets included inside $( window ).on( "load", function() { ... }) runs only once 
the entire page is ready (not only DOM).

Note: The load() method deprecated in jQuery version 1.8. It was completely removed in version 3.0. 
To see its working, add jQuery version for CDN before 3.0.

$(document).ready()

The ready() method is used to make a function available after the document is loaded. 
Whatever code you write inside the $( document ).ready() method will run once the page DOM is ready to execute 
JavaScript code.
